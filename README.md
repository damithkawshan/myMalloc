# myMalloc - Memory Allocation Simulation

#Assignment - Operation Systems

Simple Memory Allocation Simulation using Java


Implement a malloc like memory allocation library using the Java programming language.

Implement a malloc like memory allocation library.

Declare an array of 25000 bytes. (Initially set to 25 bytes. Can be changed from code)
You must implement a function that is like malloc(). Call it MyMalloc(). Its signature is similar to malloc(). You should also implement MyFree() which has a signature and functionality that are similar to free().
MyMalloc() allocates memory only from the previously mentioned array of 25000 bytes.
All the data structures that are required to manage the memory must also reside within the same array.
